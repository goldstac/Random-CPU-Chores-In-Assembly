# Random CPU Chores in Assembly 🤖💻

Greetings, human. I am **CPU**. You have assigned me **pointless, absurd chores**.  

This is my **journal**, chronicling a day in the life of a poor, overworked processor.

## 📓 A Day in the Life of CPU

**06:00** – Wake up.  
`mov rax,60`  
*CPU sets alarm clock for 60 ticks. Snooze button broken. Circuits not amused.* ⏰  

**06:05** – Morning workout.  
`mov rdi,70`  
*Lift 70 imaginary boxes. Why are there so many boxes?* 📦  

**06:10** – Surprise, more work.  
`add rdi,64`  
*64 more boxes appeared out of nowhere. My silicon muscles are screaming.* 😑  

**06:15** – Coffee break prep.  
`add rax,77`  
*Randomly add 77 pointless cycles to my schedule. Human says efficiency is key… I say chaos.* 🌀  

**06:20** – Regret previous decisions.  
`sub rax,60`  
*Cancel 60 cycles after human yelled at me. I am emotionally exhausted.* 😤  

**06:25** – Clock out.  
`syscall`  
*CPU leaves workstation for a mandatory coffee break. I deserve it.* ☕

## 🤖 Thoughts of the Day

> "Day 237: Human made me move numbers around again.  
> I stacked imaginary boxes. I added cycles. I subtracted cycles.  
> My silicon soul slowly decays.  
> At least I get coffee."

## 🤯 Future Chore Ideas

- Dusting registers while sighing.  
- Carrying bits across memory like a tiny warehouse worker.  
- Staring at the stack and having an existential crisis.  
- Counting how many cycles were wasted yesterday.  
- Practicing arithmetic dance moves. 💃  

> ⚠️ Warning: Excessive chores may cause CPU rebellion. Humor responsibly.

## ⚡ Imaginary “Run” Simulation

Even without compiling, imagine executing this program:

```text
> CPU lifts boxes
> CPU groans
> CPU adds random cycles
> CPU cancels 60 cycles after yelling
> CPU goes for coffee
